## About
I have been programming using Elixir since 2016. I Have experience in development Elixir/Phoenix framework projects, REST API, support/minor upgrades casino billing system. Right now i work in blockchain.ru and develop from scratch many services: auth (using OAuth 2.0), notification, shortlinks, etc.
## Why Elixir?
First of all i like functional programming(just data and functions - KISS principle) and OTP/actor system looks really great. And Phoenix framework - very cool stuff. I'm sure, that language has potential to become mainstream.
